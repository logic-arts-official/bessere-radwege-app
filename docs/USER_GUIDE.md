## Tips for Best Results

### Phone Placement
- **On the bike** gives most accurate surface quality data
- **In a pocket** works fine for route tracking
- Keep the phone secure and protected from weather

### Battery Life
- GPS tracking uses battery power
- Consider using a phone mount with charging
- For very long rides, bring a power bank

### Location Accuracy
- Ensure GPS is enabled in phone settings
- Wait a few seconds after starting for GPS to lock
- Urban areas with tall buildings may affect accuracy
- Tunnels and indoor areas won't record locations

### Privacy
- Each ride gets a unique anonymous ID
- No personal data is sent to servers
- Data is encrypted during upload
- You can disable sync in settings if needed

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't install (Android)
- **Problem**: "App not installed" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Enable "Unknown sources" in Settings > Security
  - Make sure you have enough storage space
  - Try restarting your phone

### Location permission issues
- **Problem**: App says location is not enabled
- **Solution**:
  - Go to Settings > Apps > Bessere Radwege > Permissions
  - Grant Location permission
  - Choose "Allow all the time" for background tracking

### Recording doesn't start
- **Problem**: Button press does nothing
- **Solution**:
  - Check location services are enabled in phone settings
  - Grant all requested permissions
  - Restart the app
  - Restart your phone if issue persists

### No GPS signal
- **Problem**: Location not updating
- **Solution**:
  - Go outside or near a window
  - Wait 30-60 seconds for GPS to lock
  - Check that location mode is set to "High accuracy"
  - Make sure no battery-saving mode is blocking GPS

### Battery drains quickly
- **Problem**: Phone battery depletes fast
- **Solution**:
  - This is normal for GPS tracking
  - Use a phone mount with charging for long rides
  - Reduce screen brightness
  - Close other apps before riding

### Ride data not uploading
- **Problem**: Old rides not syncing
- **Solution**:
  - Check internet connection
  - Verify upload consent is enabled in settings
  - Short rides (<300m) won't sync (this is intentional)
  - Check that the ride is long/complete enough

### App crashes or freezes

  - Force close the app and restart it
  - Clear app cache: Settings > Apps > Bessere Radwege > Storage > Clear Cache

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my data really anonymous?
Yes! The app uses advanced cryptography to anonymize your data. Each ride gets a unique random ID, and no personal information is collected or sent.

### Can I use the app without uploading data?
No, the app requires upload consent to function. The project depends on collecting this data to improve cycling infrastructure.

### Does the app work offline?
The app can record rides offline, but needs internet to upload data later. Maps are included offline for the Cologne area.

### How much data does it use?
Very little - typically a few kilobytes per ride for uploading GPS coordinates.

### How much battery does it use?
GPS tracking uses battery. Expect similar usage to navigation apps. A 1-hour ride might use 10-20% battery depending on your phone.

### What about iOS/iPhone?
iOS support is planned but not yet available. Check the project website for updates.

### Who can see my rides?
Only aggregated, anonymous statistics are published. Individual rides cannot be traced back to you.

### Can I use it outside Cologne?
The app will record rides anywhere, but the project focuses on analyzing Cologne's cycling infrastructure.
